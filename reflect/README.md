reflect calc in search/reflect search in calc/melt them

There are three ways to forge search and calc parts into one steel.

1. Use the search engine to search a solution, and use the calc engine to learn some meta learning indicators to guide the probe agents. The important thing is that the calc engine not only could learn the meta indicators, but also could profile the indicators' distribution.
2. Use the calc engine to model and resolve a solution, and use the search engine to speed up the converge even smoothen the converging path. The calc engine's optimizer usally consecutively optimize the model's solution, if there are many local optimal solutions, it will do many meaningless iterations to converge to a local optima, and in global scope to see that it is from one local optima to another local optima till to global optima. The search part could prune or shortcut some optimal paths to speed up the process to converge, so it also make the optimal path more smooth.
3. Melt them to get a more organic and flexible system.
